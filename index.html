  <dd><p>Jeremiah is unusual in that in the time of Jesus and the apostles it
existed in two distinct forms with essentially the same message but with
different ordering and emphases. The version that comes to us in our
English bibles is based on the longer Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT)
version, but the version quoted by the apostles and prophets of the New
Testament is the shorter Greek Septuagint (LXX) version which is in turn
based on a corresponding Hebrew version that was known in the first
century but unknown in modern times until its rediscovery in the Dead
Sea Scrolls. Scholars think the Septuagint version represents the older
textual tradition that has been expanded on in the MT, but almost all
modern editions translate from the MT, although they may include notes
as to the differences.</p>
<p>This document presents Jeremiah in LXX order using the 1870 Brenton
English translation obtained from <a
href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-Brenton_usfm.zip"
class="uri">https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-Brenton_usfm.zip</a> in
parallel with an MT-based English translation, the World English Bible
(WEB) obtained from <a
href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-web_usfm.zip"
class="uri">https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-web_usfm.zip</a>. These
translations were selected in preference to more contemporary versions
because they are in the public domain, meaning this document can also be
made freely available and free to copy. Verse numbering follows the
Brenton LXX (including a/b suffixes where present). Verse matching
between versions was prepared based on the information provided at <a
href="https://www.ccel.org/bible/brenton/Jeremiah/appendix.html"
class="uri">https://www.ccel.org/bible/brenton/Jeremiah/appendix.html</a>.
Where content appears in only one edition, the other column has a verse
number with empty content. Footnotes reproduce notes from the WEB source
text.</dd>
