<p>This page has a smattering of resources I have assembled for
reading, studying and understanding the Bible.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="sk_all_2ed.pdf">Samuel, Saul and David</a></dt>
  <dd><p>There are a number of copies of the various books that make up
  the Hebrew scriptures. For most of the Law and the Prophets the
  ‘standard’ copies (the Masoretic Text) that are used as the basis of
  almost all English translations are substantially correct, but this
  is not the case for the Samuel scrolls (the books traditionally
  called 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel in English Bibles). The ‘standard’ copies have
  many demonstrable errors. This edition is translated from a group of
  Greek and Hebrew copies that can be shown to be faithful. The reader
  will be able to confirm this by examination of the passages where
  the ‘standard’ copies differ from this edition, and comparison with
    what the Word of God teaches in other places. (This is the family
  of copies the Greek Septuagint was translated from.)</p>
    <p>This document is also available <a href="sk_all_l.epub">as an
  EPUB file</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="SSD_book.pdf">Samuel, Saul and David parallel
    edition</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This is the same edition as the above (with one or two minor
      errors fixed) presented in parallel with the World English Bible to
      facilitate comparison of versions.</p></dd>
  <dt><a href="prideaux.zip">Samuel, Saul and David USFM
    files</a></dt>
    <dd><p>If you know what USFM files are, you'll know what to do
      with these; otherwise, just ignore them.</p></dd>
  <dt><a href="jeremiah_book.pdf">Jeremiah Parallel Edition</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Jeremiah is unusual in that in the time of Jesus and the apostles it
existed in two distinct forms with essentially the same message but with
different ordering and emphases. The version that comes to us in our
English bibles is based on the longer Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT)
version, but the version quoted by the apostles and prophets of the New
Testament is the shorter Greek Septuagint (LXX) version which is in turn
based on a corresponding Hebrew version that was known in the first
century but unknown in modern times until its rediscovery in the Dead
Sea Scrolls. Scholars think the Septuagint version represents the older
textual tradition that has been expanded on in the MT, but almost all
modern editions translate from the MT, although they may include notes
as to the differences.</p>
<p>This document presents Jeremiah in LXX order using the 1870 Brenton
English translation obtained from <a
href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-Brenton_usfm.zip"
class="uri">https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-Brenton_usfm.zip</a> in
parallel with an MT-based English translation, the World English Bible
(WEB) obtained from <a
href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-web_usfm.zip"
class="uri">https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-web_usfm.zip</a>. These
translations were selected in preference to more contemporary versions
because they are in the public domain, meaning this document can also be
made freely available and free to copy. Verse numbering follows the
Brenton LXX (including a/b suffixes where present). Verse matching
between versions was prepared based on the information provided at <a
href="https://www.ccel.org/bible/brenton/Jeremiah/appendix.html"
class="uri">https://www.ccel.org/bible/brenton/Jeremiah/appendix.html</a>.
Where content appears in only one edition, the other column has a verse
number with empty content. Footnotes reproduce notes from the WEB source
text.</dd>
